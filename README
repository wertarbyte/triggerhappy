Triggerhappy is a hotkey daemon developed with small and embedded systems in
mind, e.g. linux based routers. It attaches to the input device files and
interprets the event data received and executes scripts configured in its
configuration.

Examples:

Dump all events received through two device files:

	thd --dump /dev/input/event0 /dev/input/event1

Event handlers can be defined in a configuration file (specified by --triggers)
of the following format:

<event name>	<event value>	<command line>

e.g.

KEY_VOLUMEUP	1		/usr/bin/amixer set Master 20%+
KEY_VOLUMEUP	2		/usr/bin/amixer set Master 20%+
KEY_VOLUMEDOWN	1		/usr/bin/amixer set Master 20%-
KEY_VOLUMEDOWN	2		/usr/bin/amixer set Master 20%-

A value of 1 corresponds to pressing a key, while 2 is generated by
holding it; releasing it yields a value of 0.

Devices can be added dynamically by specifying a command socket:

thd --socket /var/run/triggerhappy --triggers /etc/triggerhappy.conf

The program th-cmd is used to add new devices to the daemon:

th-cmd /var/run/triggerhappy add /dev/input/event0
th-cmd /var/run/triggerhappy remove /dev/input/event3

An example udev script is also included to facilitate this hotplug
support.
